# **Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning**

### **Project Overview**
This project aims to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics using unsupervised learning techniques. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their target audience better, enabling them to tailor marketing strategies, improve product offerings, and optimize customer experiences.

### **Steps in the Project**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and clean it by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
   - Standardize the numerical features for clustering.

2. **Clustering**:
   - Apply the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Perform **K-Means Clustering** using the optimal number of clusters.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the customer segments using scatter plots and 3D plots.
   - Analyze the different customer segments based on **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**.

4. **Cluster Analysis**:
   - Derive business insights for each customer group (e.g., premium customers, discount-seekers, value buyers).

### **Results**
- After performing clustering, customers were segmented into distinct groups based on their spending behavior and demographics.
- These segments can be used to create targeted marketing campaigns, offer personalized services, or optimize product recommendations for each customer group.

### **Business Insights**
- **High-income, high-spending customers**: Can be targeted with premium products and exclusive offers.
- **Young, low-income, high-spending customers**: Likely respond to discounts and affordable trendy products.
- **Older, low-spending customers**: May prefer practical, value-for-money offerings.
